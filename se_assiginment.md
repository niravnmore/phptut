- Low level programming is similar or closer to machine code and provides a precise control and efficiency over how a perticular task is performed.
- Low level programming are diffcult to understand and code.
- High level programming languages are similar or closer to human language and can be easily understood about what a set of instructions are trying to achieve.
- High level programming languages are mostly independent of the underlying hardware.

#### World Wide Web & How Internet Works
Q-4. Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.
- In web communication, a client is an entity that is requesting information and server is an entity that is providing the requested information.
- In normal cases, there is a single server serving multiple clients in a given duration of time.

#### Network Layers on Client and Server
Q-5. Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.
- TCP/IP model is an internet network framework used to provide reliable data communication among different devices and networks.
- Layers of TCP/IP
    - Application Layer : provides interfaces and protocols for user communication
    - Transport Layer : ensures reliable data delivery
    - Internet Layer : manages logical addressing and routing
    - Network Layer : manages physical data transmission and hardware addressing

Q-6. Explain Client Server Communication
- Client server communication is a communication model where client is requesting information, services or resources while server provides that requested information, service or resource.
- Communication is always initiated by the client while it end with completion of the request or an acknowledgement.
- A simple example is a user accessing a website through a browser, where the browser acts as a client and a remote web server acts as a server.

#### Types of Internet Connections
Q-7. How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
- Broadband and fiber-optics internet are types of internet where fiber-optics is an advanced and later version of high speed internet.
- Broadband utilises coaxial cable, DSL or satellite whereas fibre-optics uses glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as light signals.
