# Module 1 : Overview of IT Industry

#### What is a program?
Q. Explain in you own words what a program is and how it functions.
- Program is a set of instructions given to a machine, device or hardware that is able to decode it.
- The device follows the set of instructions sequentially to accomplish a task.

#### What is Programming?
Q. What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
- Programming involves understanding a given problem and producing a solution for it. It include designing algorithm, coding, testing, removing errors, deployment and maintenance. 

#### Types of Programming Languages
Q. What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?
- Low level programming is similar or closer to machine code and provides a precise control and efficiency over how a perticular task is performed.
- Low level programming are diffcult to understand and code.
- High level programming languages are similar or closer to human language and can be easily understood about what a set of instructions are trying to achieve.
- High level programming languages are mostly independent of the underlying hardware.

#### World Wide Web & How Internet Works
Q. Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.
- In web communication, a client is an entity that is requesting information and server is an entity that is providing the requested information.
- In normal cases, there is a single server serving multiple clients in a given duration of time.

#### Network Layers on Client and Server
Q. Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.
- TCP/IP model is an internet network framework used to provide reliable data communication among different devices and networks.
- Layers of TCP/IP
    - Application Layer : provides interfaces and protocols for user communication
    - Transport Layer : ensures reliable data delivery
    - Internet Layer : manages logical addressing and routing
    - Network Layer : manages physical data transmission and hardware addressing
